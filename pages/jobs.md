## High Priority Vacancies

Someone who can help making a web-technology based project reality. If you
program in Vanilla JavaScript or want to learn it, and if you are looking
forward to advance the state of typography, not just in the web, this is
your place.

## General

This is a very young company, I'm looking for someone proactive, who
is prepared to assume different roles and tasks flexibly, within reason.

### Skills

Any of the following, the more the better, and a general openness to learn
and develop some of the rest.

A keen interest in **Programming** •&nbsp;JavaScript and the Web platform
•&nbsp;Python from Font Bakery to Font Tools •&nbsp;Rust
•&nbsp;anything functional/Haskell •&nbsp;git •&nbsp;DevOps Linux/Unix •&nbsp;Fonts!

A keen interest in **Typography** •&nbsp;type design •&nbsp;font engineering
•&nbsp;scripts knowledge and linguistics •&nbsp;type setting, layout and graphic design

### Cultural Fit

In the current startup phase, cultural fit is a big decisions driving factor
for new hires, especially when considering longer term employment relationships.

STS is **open for everyone**, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible
disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. But, thusly,
the intolerant are excluded!

STS is deeply rooted in **Free/Libre Open Source Software**, you should bring
at least some sympathy and ideally intrinsic motivation. Yet, we are pragmatic
over dogmatic. Heads up: a lot of your work will be openly visible,
even before it's "finished", and the trace of your work (think: git history)
may persist forever. You'll very likely get in contact with GNU/Linux.

**no blame**


### Modes of Employment

There are several possible styles:

* Employee-- based in Nuremberg (with German social insurance)
* Freelancer -- fully remote possible
* Intern -- based in Nuremberg (with German social insurance)
* suggest your preferences

About "based in Nuremberg", remote working will be possible.
We're going to establish a hybrid local/remote concept. However, as a
foundation, the "local" aspect will always play a role. Besides, Nuremberg
is a nice place to live!
