##   Type Roof
**TypeRoof** is a browser-based infrastructure for developing and running advanced type tooling applications. It supports dynamic type proofing, animation, and resource management with a focus on openness and flexibility.

**Strong Type Systems** is actively working on expanding TypeRoof by developing new modules, refining its core architecture, and enhancing its animation capabilities. We're contributing to its growth as a robust, community-driven platform for type experimentation and tooling. Our focus is on creating stable, extensible systems that empower designers and developers to explore the full potential of type in motion and interaction.

###  Libre graphics meeting 2025 nuremberg

The Libre Graphics Meeting (LGM) is the annual gathering focused on Free/Libre and Open Source tools for design, graphics, and visual creativity. In 2025, Strong Type Systems hosted the event in Nuremberg -- taking on everything from building the website and managing finances to organizing logistics and community outreach. The Libre Graphics Meeting faced significant challenges during and after the pandemic, under the special foucus "RE:imagination" our aim was to rebuild the international community and strengthen the structures around the LGM.
