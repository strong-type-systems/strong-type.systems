###  Libre graphics meeting 2025 nuremberg

The Libre Graphics Meeting (LGM) is the annual gathering focused on Free/Libre and Open Source tools for design, graphics, and visual creativity. In 2025, Strong Type Systems hosted the event in Nuremberg -- taking on everything from building the website and managing finances to organizing logistics and community outreach. The Libre Graphics Meeting faced significant challenges during and after the pandemic, under the special foucus "RE:imagination" our aim was to rebuild the international community and strengthen the structures around the LGM.
