## TypeRoof

TypeRoof is a web-application and type tooling infrastructure. It provides
type proofing applications for parametric variable fonts -- called "Layouts" --
initially based on Video Proof and Variable Type Tools. Now, it also explores
the world of general animation with type as a principal actor and document
creation with semi-automated type-setting based on "Runions" -- a portmanteau
of "Run of Text" and "Onion".

Lasse Fister of Strong Type Systems is the principal architect and developer
of TypeRoof, partnering with David Berlow of Font Bureau in order to make
the vision of parametric typography a reality.
